# AsteroidSouls2.0
Small class project I built for a Game Development class using PyGame. 
Building old games from scratch we had to make Asteroids with a twist. I decided to do a side scroller Asteroids bullet-hell. 
The original plan was to have the rocks explode into projectiles and there to be bosses that spawn after enough waves of enemies. 
But I didn't have enough time for it. I might add those in as a future update.
